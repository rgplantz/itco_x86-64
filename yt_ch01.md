1. There are several Linux commands that show you the details of the components in your computer. For example, `lscpu` will show you the details of your CPU:
```
    $ lscpu

Other useful commands are `free` to see memory usage and `lsusb` to see your USB devices.
Chapter 3 in Brian Ward's *How Linux Works. 2nd edition*, No Starch Press, 2015, is devoted to getting information about the devices installed in your computer.
