## Solutions to Your Turn Exercises
Almost all programming problems have more than one solution. My solutions reflect my programming style, which is to emphasize simplicity and readability.

Here are my solutions to the Your Turn exercises for each chapter:

[Chapter 1,](./yt_ch01.md)
[Chapter 2,](./yt_ch02.md)
[Chapter 3,](./yt_ch03.md)

## Source Code Files
If you wish, you can download the source code files for both the Listings in the text and my solutions to the Your Turn programming exercises in a single
[zipped file](https://github.com/rgplantz/itco_x86-64/zipball/main/),
