This is the place where you'll find the source code (in markdown) for the solutions to the **Your Turn** exercises.
Or you can [view them](https://rgplantz.github.io/itco_x86-64/) online.

If you wish, you can download the source code files for both the Listings in the text and my solutions to the **Your Turn** programming exercises in a single
[zipped file](https://github.com/rgplantz/itco_x86-64/zipball/main/).
