I wrote these documents in markdown. If you would like a local copy so you can read them off line, download the source code files from my GitHub site, which is linked at the bottom of this page in the center. When you get to my GitHub site, go to my `itco_x86-64` repository. Selecting the `gh-pages` branch will show you the source files for the solutions, and the `main` branch will show you the program source files for the Listings and the programming exercises in the Your Turn sections. The `Code` button will allow you to download all the files in the branch of the repository in a single zip file.

If you go back to my home (bottom of this page), I'm posting some comments about using the markdown files.
