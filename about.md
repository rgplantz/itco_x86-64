I wrote these documents in markdown. If you would like a local copy so you can read them off line, download the source code files from my GitHub site, which is linked at the bottom of this page in the center. Whne you get to my GitHub site, go to my `itco_x86-64` reposiory and select the `gh-pages` branch. The `Code` button will allow you to download all the files in the repository in a single zip file.

If you go back to my home (bottom of this page), I'm posting some comments about using the markdown files.
